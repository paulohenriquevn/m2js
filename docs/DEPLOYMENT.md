## Overview

M2JS has two main distribution channels:
1. **NPM Package**: `@paulohenriquevn/m2js` (CLI tool)
2. **VS Code Extension**: `m2js-vscode` (IDE integration)

Both are automatically deployed via GitHub Actions when tags are created.

## NPM Package Deployment

### üîß Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure you have npm access
npm whoami
# Should return your npm username

# Check if you're a collaborator on the package
npm owner ls @paulohenriquevn/m2js
```

### üöÄ Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy is using our automated pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: prepare for release v1.1.0"
git push origin main

# 2. Create and push a version tag
npm version patch  # for bug fixes
npm version minor  # for new features  
npm version major  # for breaking changes

# 3. Push the tag to trigger deployment
git push --tags

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Run all tests and quality checks
# - Build the package
# - Publish to NPM
# - Create GitHub release
# - Update documentation
```

### üìä Deployment Pipeline Status

Monitor the deployment at:
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/paulohenriquevn/m2js/actions
- **NPM Package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paulohenriquevn/m2js
- **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/paulohenriquevn/m2js/releases

### üîç Version Strategy

```bash
# Semantic Versioning (semver)
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

# Examples:
1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1  # Bug fix (patch)
1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.1.0  # New feature (minor)
1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0  # Breaking change (major)

# Pre-release versions
1.1.0-alpha.1  # Alpha release
1.1.0-beta.1   # Beta release
1.1.0-rc.1     # Release candidate
```

### üìã Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a release tag:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Quality Gates
npm run validate    # All tests, linting, type-checking
npm run build      # Successful build
npm run test:coverage  # Adequate test coverage

# ‚úÖ Manual Testing
npm link
m2js examples/User.ts              # Basic functionality
m2js examples/User.ts --ai-enhanced # Advanced features
m2js examples/ --batch             # Batch processing

# ‚úÖ Documentation
# Update CHANGELOG.md with new features/fixes
# Update README.md if needed
# Update version in package.json (npm version does this)

# ‚úÖ Backward Compatibility
# Ensure CLI flags still work
# Ensure VS Code extension compatibility
# Test with existing user workflows
```

## VS Code Extension Deployment

### üîß Prerequisites

```bash
# Install VSCE (VS Code Extension Manager)
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Get a Personal Access Token from:
# https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORG/_usersSettings/tokens
# Scopes needed: Marketplace (Manage)
```

### üì¶ Extension Packaging

```bash
cd vscode-extension

# 1. Update version in package.json
npm version patch

# 2. Compile extension
npm run compile

# 3. Package extension
vsce package

# Output: m2js-vscode-X.Y.Z.vsix
```

### üöÄ Extension Publishing

#### Automated (via GitHub Actions)
```bash
# Extensions are automatically published when tags are created
git tag v1.1.0
git push --tags

# GitHub Actions will:
# - Build both CLI and extension
# - Package extension
# - Publish to VS Code Marketplace
# - Update extension listing
```

#### Manual Publishing
```bash
cd vscode-extension

# Login to marketplace (one-time setup)
vsce login YOUR-PUBLISHER-NAME

# Publish extension
vsce publish

# Or publish specific version
vsce publish 1.1.0

# Or publish pre-release
vsce publish --pre-release
```

### üìã Extension Review Process

VS Code Marketplace has an automated review process:

1. **Upload**: Extension is uploaded and scanned
2. **Validation**: Automated security and quality checks
3. **Review**: Manual review for policy compliance (if flagged)
4. **Publication**: Extension becomes available (usually within 1 hour)

## GitHub Releases

### üîÑ Automated Release Creation

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates releases:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml triggers on tags
name: Release & Publish
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*.*.*']

# Creates:
# - GitHub Release with changelog
# - NPM package publication
# - VS Code extension publication
# - Release assets (CLI binaries, extension .vsix)
```

## Troubleshooting

### üö® Common Deployment Issues

#### NPM Publish Failures
```bash
# Issue: 403 Forbidden
# Solution: Check NPM authentication
npm whoami
npm login

# Issue: Version already exists
# Solution: Increment version
npm version patch

# Issue: Package too large
# Solution: Check .npmignore
npm pack --dry-run
```

#### VS Code Extension Issues
```bash
# Issue: Extension validation failed
# Solution: Check package.json manifest
vsce package --no-dependencies

# Issue: Marketplace login failed
# Solution: Regenerate access token
vsce login YOUR-PUBLISHER

# Issue: Extension not appearing
# Solution: Check marketplace status
# Visit: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
```

#### GitHub Actions Failures
```bash
# Issue: Tests failing on CI
# Solution: Run locally first
npm run validate
npm test

# Issue: Secrets not configured
# Solution: Check repository settings
# GitHub Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions

# Issue: Workflow not triggering
# Solution: Check tag format
git tag v1.1.0  # Must start with 'v'
```

### üõü Emergency Procedures

#### Rollback Deployment
```bash
# NPM: Cannot delete published versions
# Instead: Publish new version with fix
npm version patch
npm publish

# VS Code: Can unpublish within 72 hours
vsce unpublish

# GitHub: Delete release and tag
git tag -d v1.1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.1.0
```

#### Critical Security Issue
```bash
# 1. Immediately unpublish if possible
vsce unpublish  # VS Code extension
# NPM: Contact npm support for critical security

# 2. Create security patch
git checkout -b security-patch
# Fix security issue
# Test thoroughly

# 3. Emergency release
npm version patch
git push --tags

# 4. Notify users
# Create GitHub security advisory
